We're excited to announce the launch of **Treeborn Games**, a new independent game studio dedicated to creating immersive, nature-inspired gaming experiences!

## About Treeborn Games

Treeborn Games was founded with a vision to develop games that celebrate our connection with the natural world. We believe games can foster meaningful relationships with nature through thoughtful interaction and innovative mechanics.

## A New Project Begins

Today, we're thrilled to share that production has begun on our debut title, currently codenamed **Wildwarden**. This project will blend elements of RPG gameplay with nature restoration in ways we hope will feel fresh and engaging.

While we're keeping most details under wraps for now, we can share that Wildwarden will invite players to:

- Connect with natural environments in meaningful ways
- Experience gameplay that emphasizes harmony and restoration
- Explore beautiful, diverse biomes with unique characteristics

Our goal is to create an experience that feels different from traditional games in the genre, with a focus on working with natural systems rather than against them.

## Development Journey

Wildwarden is currently in early production. As a small independent studio, we're committed to a thoughtful, measured development process. We'll be sharing occasional updates as the project progresses, being careful not to promise more than we can deliver.

We're excited about this journey and look forward to gradually revealing more about our vision as development continues.
