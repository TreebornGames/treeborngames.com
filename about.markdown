## Treeborn Games

Treeborn Games is an independent game development studio dedicated to creating immersive experiences that celebrate the natural world. We specialize in games that blend ecosystem simulation with engaging gameplay mechanics.

### Our Philosophy

We believe games can foster a deeper connection with nature through thoughtful interaction and meaningful mechanics. Our projects focus on:

- **Ecosystem Balance**: Creating living worlds where player actions have ripple effects
- **Non-Traditional Gameplay**: Exploring new ways to interact with virtual environments
- **Inclusive Design**: Crafting experiences that welcome players of all backgrounds
- **Environmental Themes**: Telling stories that highlight our relationship with the natural world

### Current Projects

We're currently developing **Wildwarden**, a farming/RPG hybrid where players restore corrupted ecosystems through sustainable interaction rather than conventional farming mechanics.
